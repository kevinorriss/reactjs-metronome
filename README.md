# Metronome

A ReactJS Metronome component inspired by Google's implementation

## Prerequisites

## Installing

```

## Usage

...

<!-- JSX -->
<div className="your-container">
    <Metronome />
</div>
```

## Development

This repo comes with a react app for development purposes. To get started, open a terminal in the root of the project and then:

### Link the component to the app
```
cd ./component
yarn link

cd ..
yarn link @kevinorriss/metronome
```

### Start the app
```
yarn start
```

### Start the rollup watcher

```

Whenever you make a change to the component code, the react app will update.

This project uses Jest and Enzyme for its unit tests, simply run the above code to run the test suites.

If you want the tests to run during development, you will need to have rollup watching too!
